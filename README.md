# Developer Experience On Kubernertes

This repository contains source code, configuration, and additional appendixes accompanying the [Developer Experience on Kubernetes](https://www.manning.com/books/developer-experience-on-kubernetes) book by [Mauricio Salatino](https://salaboy.com) and [Thomas Vitale](https://www.thomasvitale.com), published by Manning.

There is a folder for each chapter, for which both an initial and final versions are available for Go and Java. For example, for chapter 2, you can use `chapter02/java/begin` as a starting point to follow along with the examples in the chapter and `chapter02/java/end` to check the code as it looks like at the end.
